## Verifiable Credentials Lifecycle

This document describes a typical lifecycle of a Verifiable Credential. Note
that other lifecycles are contemplated and this document is meant purely as
an example.

We encourage contributions meeting the [Contribution
Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).  While we prefer the creation of issues
and Pull Requests in the GitHub repository, discussions often occur
on the
[public-credentials](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-credentials/)
mailing list as well.
