    <h1>Introduction</h1>

    <p>
This document starts by looking at how people are given identity attributes
 in real life, and then takes the lessons learnt from this to 
apply them to verifiable credentials.

    <h1>Identify Information Lifecycle</h1>

    <p>
Before diving into the lifecycle of verifiable credentials (VCs) let’s
look at the lifecycle of the identity information that is inserted
into VCs by the issuers.
    </p>

    <section>
      <h2>Newborn Child</h2>
      <p>
When a baby is born he/she has no official identity and no information
about him/her exists anywhere in either paper or digital format.
One of the first things to happen is that the baby is registered
and obtains a birth certificate. This contains the baby’s name
and those of its parents. It may be a paper document or a digital
one or both. It is issued by the national name registration authority.
This initial registration is a critical component of all that follows.
      </p>
      <p>
As the baby progresses, he/she will be registered with a local doctor,
a playgroup, a nursery school etc. and the amount of identity information
stored about him/her by different organisations, in either paper
or electronic format, will grow throughout the person’s lifetime.
Sometimes one of these organisation’s might require the child’s
birth certificate to authenticate the applicant, sometimes it may
rely on identity information provided by the parent or other third
party (typically another identity providing organization). The
precise procedure is dictated by the organization according to
its risk assessment.
      </p>
      <p>
As the child grows, and moves between addresses, playgroups, schools etc.
the identity information held by an organization, which was once
correct, is no longer correct. It has to be modified and/or deleted,
e.g. a playgroup may simply destroy records about children who
no longer attend it. Sometimes the update depends upon the child
(or more likely his/her parents) informing the organization that
the details they hold are no longer correct, at other times the
organization may unilaterally make the update itself e.g. if a
person has not been seen by an organization for a year or more
the assumption may be made that the person is no longer interested
in the service that the organisation offers and their identity
information is simply deleted e.g. they are removed from the membership
list. Unfortunately some organisations will not update the identity
information that they hold, and then the person will have different
conflicting identity information stored about them by different
organisations. This may or may not cause the person problems in
the future. It all depends on who the organisations are and what
identity information they hold.
      </p>
      <p>
Ultimately the child will grow into an adult, and much more identity information
will be collected, modified and deleted about them by dozens of
organisations. Eventually the person will die. All the data held
about the person should be updated and or deleted, to record this
final fact. But in some cases it may not be. It might simply be
archived as a record of past events, or may even be left intact
and unaltered. If this information is not updated, then it is possible
for an imposter to pose as the dead person and to assume their
identity information. This is known to have happened many times.
      </p>
      <p>
The person has very little proof that he/she is the person being referred
to in the identity information held by the various organizations
that created it. He/she might have a paper certificate, but might
not have. If the person wants to retrieve a copy of any of this
identity information, he/she will have to be authenticated by each
organization in order to prove that they are the person referred
to in the information that the organization holds. Because this
binding is quite weak in many cases, masquerade is possible e.g.
people are known to have requested the birth certificates of third
parties in order to assume their identities, and unqualified people
are known to have masqueraded successfully as surgeons and performed
operations on patients without having the necessary qualifications.
Biometrics are the best known method of binding the human to the
information that is held about him/her, and many modern information
documents (either physical or electronic) contain a biometric of
the human in order to bind them to the information e.g. a photograph
of the holder on a driver’s licence, several fingerprints of the
owner stored in a PC etc. Clearly biometrics are the way to go,
but many organisations are not yet at this point, and often require
little more than the name and address of the person for authentication
purposes. This clearly facilitates the risk of identity theft.
      </p>
      <p>
Several key points to note are:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
Even though the identity information is personally identifiable 1. Even
though the identity information is personally identifiable information
(PII) about the person in question, <i>the person is not the source of or owner of the information.</i>
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>Each piece of information is created by the organisation</i>          that interacts with the person. We might call this organisation
the Source of Authority (SoA) or Attribute Authority (AA). In
the VC work it is called the Issuer.
        </li>
        <li>
The identity information might be held by the person, e.g. as a paper certificate,
or it might not be held by the person e.g. medical data, but
          <i>the identity information will always be held by the SoA, in either paper or electronic format (or both)</i>.
        </li>
        <li>
The SoA will update its identity information from time to time, sometimes
unilaterally, sometimes based on prompts from the person concerned.
But sometimes the information is not updated at all, and becomes
inaccurate or stale.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>There is no foolproof link that binds the person to the identity information held about him/her by the SoA</i>,
but biometrics are currently the best known method of doing this.
However some organisations have very weak bindings between the
person and the information they hold, and this poses a significant
opportunity for identity theft.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Immigrant/Refugee</h2>
      <p>
Immigrants and refugees are new entrants to a country, so with respect
to the identity information that is already held about them by
organisations in their new home country, they are like a newborn
baby. However, there is one significant difference: they have an
identity in the country they have left, which they may or may not
want to bring with them. Consequently there are three cases to
consider: the immigrant/refugee wishes to ‘import’ his foreign
identity into his new home country; the refugee wishes to start
with a completely new identity in his new home country, one that
has no connection to his previous one (we assume that this option
is not available to the immigrant who comes with a passport); and
the immigrant/refugee wishes to masquerade in his new home country
as a different person (the other ‘masqueraded’ person may be alive
or dead, and may be from the same or different country to the immigrant/refugee).
      </p>
      <section>
        <h3>Import Foreign Identity</h3>
        <p>
If the person is an immigrant or refugee with a valid passport and other
documentation such as paper certificates, then it will be relatively
easy for him/her to be registered in several organizational information
systems in the new home country. Some, such as the government,
will accept the paper documentation ‘as is’ after running a standard
validation test e.g. on the passport, others may accept it after
doing more extensive validation of their own e.g. a university
may allow registration onto a postgraduate degree course based
on the foreign paper undergraduate degree certificate; whilst
others may only partially accept it or not accept it all, and
require the person to pass their own examinations before awarding
them the qualification/certificate/membership (i.e. identity
information) that they are claiming e.g. a foreign qualified
doctor wishing to work in the UK National Health Service must
undergo local exams before being allowed to practice.
        </p>
        <p>
When the person has no documentary evidence to prove his/her entitlement
to the claimed identity information from the foreign country,
this poses a significant challenge to the person. In the worst
case, they may have to forgo importing this identity information,
and strive to obtain it again from scratch in the new home country.
        </p>
        <p>
Once the person has been registered in the new home country, he/she can
progress to amass identity information in the same way as the
newborn baby who was registered at birth.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Completely new identity</h3>
        <p>
Since the home country has no information stored about the refugee, he/she
can assume any identity they chose. It does not matter what identity
they choose. The only constraints are that the identity information
appears to be correct in terms of gender, age and ethnicity;
does not already exist in the home country; and if very similar
identity information does already exist, then the refugee must
make it clear that they do not wish to assume this identity information
and point out the differences between it and their own new identity
information. Different countries will have different procedures
for accepting refugees, but will have one thing in common. The
refugee’s name will be recorded, and the country will store other
identity information about him/her bound to that name. It is
most likely today that biometric information will be captured
from the refugee to ensure that they are a new person who does
not already exist in the country’s records. The record may be
paper based or electronic, but is most likely to be in both formats
today e.g. an ID card with name and photograph, and an ICT based
record with various biometrics and other identity information.
        </p>
        <p>
Once registered, the refugee can progress to collecting identity information
from other organisations in the same way as the newborn baby
who was registered at birth. Obviously there are some differences,
since the latter is a child whilst the former is probably (though
not always) an adult and therefore entitled to more and/or different
services.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Masquerade as someone else</h3>
        <p>
If the person has successfully masqueraded as someone else in his/her home
country, and has arrived at the new country with a ‘valid’ passport
in the masqueraded name, then it may be relatively easy for the
foreigner to take on the fake identity by following the procedure
outlined in 1.2.1 above. If the person arrives without any identity
documentation, then he/she could follow the procedure outlined
in 1.2.2 above since no identity information about the person
is yet held by the new country. Consequently registering a false
name and date of birth might be relatively straightforward, and
no more difficult than registering the true information.
        </p>
        <p>
It may be more difficult for the person to successfully steal quality identity
information about the masqueraded person, such as qualifications,
employment records etc., because somehow they will have to prove
to the new home country that this identity information is bound
to themselves, and not to the masqueraded person. But as noted
above, because the binding between a physical person and the
identity information held about him/her by the issuing organization
is often very weak, then it may be possible to trick the issuing
organization and the home country into believing the masquerade.
        </p>
      </section>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Conclusions</h2>
      <p>
Identity information about one person is held by multiple organisations
in different forms, sometimes paper based, sometimes electronic,
sometimes both. The identity information may be out of date in
one or more organisations, and may conflict with that held by other
organisations. The opportunity to steal identity information from
some organisations by masquerading as someone else is relatively
easy due to the weak bindings that the organization has between
the physical person and the identity information it holds about
them.
      </p>
      <p>
The objective of verifiable credentials is to allow people to obtain identity
information about themselves in a digital format, which is cryptographically
protected and strongly bound to themselves, thereby making masquerade
and identity theft much more difficult than in today’s world, whilst
simultaneously giving the person more control over who has access
to his digital identity information and allowing the recipients
to verify its authenticity.
      </p>
    </section>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h1>Verifiable Credentials Lifecycle</h1>

    <p>
The architecture for the Verifiable Credentials ecosystem is shown below.
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="diagrams/lifecycle.jpg" />
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Figure 1. The Verifiable Credentials Architecture</b>
    </p>
    <p>
In Figure 1, the person holding the VC is the subject of the VC. However,
the information content of a VC is owned and held by the issuer.
The exception to this is the identifier to which the identity information
is attached. The identifier is owned by the holder. The recipient
of the VCs is the verifier, and it must trust the issuer(s) if it
is to validate the VCs successfully. If it does not trust an issuer,
the verifier may not accept a VC as valid information. The VCs are
held by the holder in a repository of his/her choosing, which may
be local or remote, centralized or distributed.
    </p>
    <p>
Given the above VC architecture and identity information lifecycle, then
the lifecycle of a VC is as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
1. The holder obtains an identifier. This could be a public key or a blockchain
distributed ID.
    </p>
    <p>
2. The holder contacts the issuer and requests a verifiable credential.
    </p>
    <p>
3. The issuer authenticates the holder, validates that he/she possesses
the identifier, and checks its records to see if the holder is entitled
to the requested credential. If any of these checks fail, the request
is rejected. If they all pass, then
    </p>
    <p>
4. The issuer issues the verifiable credential and returns it to the holder
    </p>
    <p>
5. The holder stores the verifiable credential in his/her repository
    </p>
    <p>
6. The holder presents his/her verifiable credential(s) to a verifier
    </p>
    <p>
7. The verifier may accept the credentials without validating them, or
may perform either partial validation or full validation of each
VC at its choice. This in part depends upon the risk model adopted
by the verifier, and the nature of the interaction with the holder.
Credential validation includes the following (at least): the verifiable
credential belongs to the holder, the holder possesses the identifier
in the credential, the issuer is trusted to issue the information
in the credential, the credential has not been revoked by the issuer,
the credential is still within its validity period, and any other
issuer policy information in the credential is respected (e.g. if
the credential is one-time-use this is the first time it has been
used, if the credential has a restricted set of verifiers then it
is an allowed verifier).
    </p>
    <p>
8. At some point in time the issuer may decide to revoke the verifiable
credential, after which it bears no liability for the acceptance
of the credential by an verifier.
    </p>
    <p>
9. If the verifiable credential has an expiry time, then when this is reached,
the holder should discard the credential.
    </p>

  </section>

  <section>

    <h1>Trust Model for Verifiable Credentials</h1>

    <p>
Given the above VC model it is clear that a trust model is needed to inform
the actors how to deal with the VCs they are presented with.
    </p>
    <p>
The VC trust model is relatively simple.
    </p>
    <p>
1. The verifier trusts the issuer to issue the VC that it receives (although
this trust could be weakened depending upon the risk assessment of
the verifier).
    </p>
    <p>
2. The issuer, the holder and the verifier trust the identifier registry
to be un-corruptible and to be a correct record of which identifiers
belong to which holders.
    </p>
    <p>
3. The holder trusts the issuer to issue true (i.e. not false) credentials,
and to revoke them quickly when requested to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
Note in particular that the issuer and the verifier do not (need to) trust
the repository, and that the issuer does not (need to) trust the
verifier. Furthermore the user does not need to trust the repository
to securely hold its VCs, although most users will. If the repository
loses or corrupts a VC the holder can simply ask the issuer for a
new VC, although this may be at some cost and inconvenience to the
holder. Because of this, we may add a new optional trust rule:
    </p>
    <p>
4. The user trusts the repository to store his/her VCs securely, to not
release them to anyone other than the user, and to not corrupt or
lose them whilst they are in its care.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h1>Delegation of Authority</h1>

    <p>
There are three different scenarios where delegation of authority are important
to VCs.
    </p>
    <section>
      <h2>Delegation by the Issuer</h2>
      <p>
Delegation of authority by the issuer increases the scalability of VCs
by distributing the management and/or issuing of identity information
to multiple issuers (which we will term Subordinate Issuers), rather
than a single issuer (which we will term the Source of Authority
        - SoA). Holders now have relationships with the subordinate issuers
rather than with the SoA.
      </p>
      <p>
Two different delegation mechanisms are typically used today, which we
term downwards delegation and upwards delegation. An example of
the former is the issuing of Visa credit cards by issuing banks
rather than Visa Inc., and of the latter is the issuing of national
student cards in the UK by the National Union of Students (NUS)
rather than each university.
      </p>
      <p>
In the downwards delegation mechanism the SoA publishes a signed list of
subordinate issuers, to which the SoA has delegated VC issuing.
This list must be accessible to all verifiers who trust the SoA.
The SoA can dynamically update this list as required. Holders will
register with one of the subordinate issuers, and have their information
managed by it, and their VCs issued by it. The verifier can validate
any of the issued VCs by checking that the subordinate issuer that
signed the VC (and any revocation list) is in the list of subordinate
issuers signed by the SoA. Whilst more validation work needs to
be done by the verifier e.g. list retrieval and two (or three)
signature verifications instead of one (or two), the holder user-experience
remains the same, as does the credential and revocation issuing
mechanisms.
      </p>
      <p>
In the upwards delegation mechanism there is no need for the SoA to publish
a list of trusted subordinate issuers. Instead, the subordinate
issuers delegate the credential issuing to their SoA, which issues
credentials on their behalf. A subordinate issuer’s primary task
is to manage the holders and their identity information. Consequently
the user must additionally register with the SoA in order to obtain
a VC. This registration process must contain some authentication
information known only to the holder and the subordinate issuer,
such as an Activation Code. The SoA contacts the holder’s subordinate
issuer by some proprietary means to validate the authenticator
and confirm that the holder is entitled to the requested information
before issuing the VC(s). With this mechanism, the verifier’s validation
procedure does not change, since it only trusts the SoA, and all
VCs are issued (and revoked) by the SoA. However, the holder’s
registration procedure is more cumbersome and/or time consuming
due to the double registration. Revocation is also more time consuming
as it involves communication between the subordinate issuer and
the SoA.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Delegation by the Holder</h2>
      <p>
Delegation of authority by the holder allows a third party to assert a
VC either for itself, or on behalf of the holder. Both acts are
undertaken today. A holder may delegate (give) a club membership
card to a friend, allowing the friend to enter the club. Power
of Attorney (PoA) is where a third party is given legal authority
to act on behalf of the holder, by the holder signing a PoA form.
In both cases the original credential is not modified. In the former
case the verifier has no evidence that the delegation actually
took place. Consequently it can only work when the credential is
a bearer credential i.e. the credential belongs to whoever holds
it. In the PoA case, the verifier is given evidence (i.e. the signed
PoA form) that the presenter is acting on behalf of the holder,
as well as being presented with the original VC.
      </p>
      <p>
Recursion is a central concept of computer science. We can apply recursion
to VCs to support both acts of delegation of authority by the holder
to a third party. In this procedure, the holder becomes the issuer,
the third party becomes the new holder, and the content of the
new VC is the original VC of the holder. Since the procedure is
recursive, the third party who is now the holder, could delegate
the VC to a fourth party by becoming the issuer. Whether we want
to allow infinite recursion, or limit it in some way is for further
discussion. In the initial act of delegation, the holder should
set his/her policy for the delegation e.g. whether the new holder
can assert the VC for itself, or only on behalf of the original
holder. In order to validate a delegated VC, the verifier modifies
the usual VC validation procedure, to first obtain the information
content of the VC. If it determines that this is a VC, the verifier
recursively repeats this validation procedure on the embedded VC
until the original information content is obtained. It then validates
the original VC. If this is trusted, the issuer proceeds back up
the delegation chain to the current holder, to ensure that each
previous holder acted as issuer to the next holder.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h3>Delegation by the Verifier</h3>
      <p>
In this scenario the verifier delegates the validation of the VC to another
entity e.g. a front end gateway, to authorise the holder on behalf
of the verifier. If the delegation process is not visible to the
holder or the external world, then no special procedure is needed.
The delegate can act on behalf of the verifier without any external
entity being aware of this. But if the delegation process is externally
visible, for example, the holder initially contacts the verifier
and is redirected to the delegate, then the holder will be aware
of this redirection. If there are policy fields in the VC that
stipulate which holders are allowed to process the VC, then this
redirection may violate this policy and the holder may be unwilling
to follow the redirection. Even if the holder follows the redirection,
the validation software may reject the VC when it processes the
policy field. This form of delegation could be enabled by the verifier
issuing a ‘delegation’ VC to the delegate. This VC would have the
delegate as the subject, the verifier as the issuer, and the attribute
would be ‘entitled to act on behalf of the issuer’.

    <h1>Dispute Resolution</h1>

    <p>
The situation may arise when a holder determines that the identity information
held by an issuer is incorrect, and consequently, that all VCs issued
by the issuer to the holder contain incorrect information. This is
a tricky situation, since the issuer is the owner of the information
that it issues, but the holder knows whether the information is correct
or not. Before changing any of the held information, the issuer needs
to be convinced that it is incorrect, that the requester is the true
holder (and not an imposter) and that the holder is not trying to
either insert false information or remove true information.
    </p>
    <p>
Consequently it is recommended that all VC issuers publish their procedures
by which holders may
    </p>
    <p>
i) obtain the complete set of information held by the issuer about the
holder
    </p>
    <p>
ii) determine which subset of this information may be issued as VCs to
the holder (and as a corollary, which must not be inserted into VCs)
    </p>
    <p>
iii) obtain one or more VCs
    </p>
    <p>
iv) ask for an issued VC to be revoked
    </p>
    <p>
v) ask for information held by the issuer to be updated
    </p>
    <p>
vi) resolve disputes arising from either the information held by the issuer
about the holder, or the issuing and revoking of VCs by the issuer
to the holder.
    </p>
    <p>
Legislation such as the EU GDPR [http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/reform/files/regulation_oj_en.pdf]
provide the holder with the right to request a copy of the information
held by the issuer, the right to correct erroneous information, and
the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority if any
dispute with the issuer cannot be resolved amicably.

    <h1>Negative Credentials</h1>

    <p>
Sometimes issuers will issue credentials containing negative information
about the holder e.g. points on a driving license. If the compound
identity information, such as a driving license, has been atomized
into multiple VCs by the issuer, e.g. to allow the holder to assert
a subset of the information to an verifier, then holders are very
likely to withhold VCs containing negative information.
    </p>
    <p>
Possible solutions to this problem are:
    </p>
    <p>
      - issuers do not atomise negative information into separate VCs but bind
it together with other identity information in a VC so that the holder
cannot assert one piece of information without the other,
    </p>
    <p>
      - verifiers can mandate that negative claims are presented, containing
      ‘null’ if the subject has no negative attribute. Examples here include:
getting a ‘no criminal record’ credentials from the police when applying
for a child care job.
    </p>
    <p>
      - verifiers use out of band means to contact issuers to request any negative
information that they possess about the holder.
    </p>
    <p>
After discussion within the VC working group it was agreed that the semantic
of a claim in a VC is outside the scope of the current work, because
what is a negative claim to one verifier may be a positive claim
to another e.g. a conviction for causing grievous bodily harm may
be positive to a nightclub owner looking for a bouncer. Consequently
the topic of negative credentials is considered out of scope of the
current work.

    <h1>Holder is not the Subject</h1>

    <p>
In the majority of cases the holder of a VC will be the subject of the
VC. In some special cases a third party will be the holder of someone
else’s VC. This may be the case when the holder has delegated his/her
VCs to a third party, as described above. Alternatively, someone
in authority may present VCs to verifiers, which refer to the verifier’s
customers e.g. a credit reference agency presents a credit reference
VC to an verifier. Alternatively a close associate of a subject may
present the subject’s VC to an verifier on behalf of the subject
e.g. a patient’s spouse may present a prescription VC to a pharmacist
in order to collect the drugs for the patient.
    </p>
    <p>
In other special cases a VC may not contain a single subject, for example
a marriage certificate contains two subjects, whilst bearer VCs do
not contain a subject at all.
    </p>
    <p>
In most cases the verifier will need to know who is presenting a VC to
it, in order to stop false claims being asserted by random holders.
If the holder is the subject, then the verifier only needs to verify
      ‘proof of possession’ of the VC, without learning anything else about
the identity of the subject, other than that contained in the VC.
If the holder is not the subject, and the VC is not a bearer VC,
then the issuer needs to verify that the holder is authorized to
present the VC. In the case of delegation of authority, this can
be done by validating the delegation chain. In the case of someone
in authority presenting the VC, the verifier needs to authenticate
the holder and validate that they are authorized to present the VCs
of third parties. In some use cases, such as prescription VCs, the
verifier may allow anyone to present the VC and only check that the
VC is valid.
    </p>
    <p>
Bearer VCs are special in that they belong to whoever holds them. Consequently
they can be stolen, copied or used by whoever gets access to them.
For these reasons the security of bearer VCs needs careful consideration.

    <h1>Revocation</h1>

    <p>
There are two aspects of revocation that are potentially of concern to
VC stakeholders, in particular, to verifiers. The first is that which
is typically referred to as revocation in the PKI world, and this
means that the VC should not be trusted because either the cryptography
is broken, or the private key of the issuer or subject has been stolen
etc. In this first case, the underlying identity information is still
valid e.g. the subject is still a citizen of the country, is still
a member of the club etc. but the VC cannot be relied upon to verify
this. For example, a thief might be able to use a cryptographically
broken VC to masquerade as the subject, hence it needs to be revoked.
The second aspect is that the underlying assertion is no longer valid
e.g. the subject is dead or is no longer a member of the club etc.
Since the VC working group is not interpreting the semantics of the
VC attributes, then this latter aspect is out of scope of the working
group (in just the same way that negative VCs are out of scope).
Consequently we will only concentrate on revoking VCs as part of
their life cycle, when the cryptography cannot be relied upon to
verify the VC.
